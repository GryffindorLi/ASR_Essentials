# ASR Essentials

This repo contains Numpy code for some important components in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The intention for this repo is to self-teaching.

Components that are going to implement are as follows:

- [x] Preprocessing (FBanks & MFCC)
- [x] CTC
- [x] CTC Beam Search
- [ ] N-gram LM
- [ ] Beam Search with n-gram LM
- [ ] RNN-Transducer
- [ ] RNN-T Beam Search
